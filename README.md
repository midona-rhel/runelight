# RuneLight

Lighting-focused GPU renderer for RuneLite. OpenGL 3.3/4.1 core so it runs on macOS, Windows and Linux.

Currently a faithful fork of RuneLite's GPU renderer (1.13.2) used as the baseline.

## Run

```
./gradlew run
```

or run `RuneLightPluginTest` (src/test) from IntelliJ with the project root as working directory.
Turn off the built-in GPU plugin; RuneLight refuses to start while it is enabled.

Logging in with a Jagex account: run the RuneLite launcher once with `--insecure-write-credentials`.

## Shader hot reload

In developer mode, shaders are read straight from `src/main/resources/com/midonarhel/runelight/` and recompiled
whenever a `.glsl` file is saved. A broken shader keeps the last working one running and reports the error,
with the original file and line, in game chat and the log.

Override the directory with `-Drunelight.shaderDir=/path`.

## Development settings

Plugin config, Development section:

- Show GPU timings: GPU ms for the scene and for UI + present, measured with non-blocking timestamp queries.
- Check GL errors: glGetError after each draw step. Slow, keep off when measuring.
- Debug view: show the depth or normal buffer instead of the final image.

## Lights

Point light placements come from 117 HD's light definitions, converted with `tools/import_117hd_lights.py`
(see the script for usage). Rerun it against a newer 117 HD checkout to pick up their additions.

## Areas

Which area the camera is in, whether it is under the open sky or underground, and each area's light tint, fog and
sky haze come from `environments.json`, built by `tools/import_environments.py` from 117 HD's areas and
environments with 3D Weather's biome regions as fallback (see the script for usage and what it leaves out).
Rerun it against newer checkouts to pick up their additions. The biome looks (desert, swamp, snow, ...) are set in
the script's `BIOMES` table.
